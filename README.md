# Room-Booking-Solutions
This project is a program written for students of Bennett University, Greater Noida, India. It is a program that allows students to reserve certain rooms on campus for educational / entertainment purposes. The otherwise available solution to reserving a room requires inputs from various different bodies within the university and is therefore, quite lengthy.
